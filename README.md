contact page: this contact form sends the quries to admin email and confirmation mail sends back to user mail.

Write calculations using functions and get the results. Let's have a look at some examples:

seven(times(five())) # must return 35
four(plus(nine())) # must return 13
eight(minus(three())) # must return 5
six(divided_by(two())) # must return 3

Division should be integer division. For example, this should return 2, not 2.666666...:

eight(divided_by(three()))
